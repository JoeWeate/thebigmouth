# Hooks

This folder contains custom hooks, including API functions. Hooks are reusable pieces of logic that can be shared across different components. They are particularly useful for managing state, side effects, and other common functionalities.

## What are Hooks?

Hooks in this folder include:

- **useFetch:** A custom hook for handling data fetching from APIs.
- **useLocalStorage:** A hook for interacting with the browser's local storage.
- **useForm:** A hook for managing form state and validation.

## Examples of Hooks:

1. **useFetch:**
   - `useFetch.js`: A hook for making HTTP requests and handling loading and error states.

2. **useLocalStorage:**
   - `useLocalStorage.js`: A hook for interacting with local storage, useful for persisting data.

3. **useForm:**
   - `useForm.js`: A hook for managing form state, handling input changes, and validation.

## How to Use:

To use these hooks, import the desired hook into your component. For example, in a React component file:

```javascript
// Example in a React component file
import React from 'react';
import useFetch from './hooks/useFetch';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const { data, loading, error } = useFetch('https://api.example.com/data');

  if (loading) {
    return <p>Loading...</p>;
  }

  if (error) {
    return <p>Error: {error.message}</p>;
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Your Component Content</h1>
      {/* Use data retrieved from the API */}
      {data && <p>{data}</p>}
    </div>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
